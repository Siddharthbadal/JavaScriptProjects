In terms of physical design, I don’t blame anyone for not being able to distinguish between a S21, S22 and this current model. Aside from the previously segmented camera bump corner on the rear, the basic S models have retained essentially the same body for years now. That’s not to say that it's a negative thing as this is one of the best remaining one handed mobile phones left in the US market. With a relatively smaller (by modern standards) 6.1 inch AMOLED display, the S23 is quite comfortable to hold with one hand. That 1080 x 2340 p display has a 120 Hz refresh rate and a 19.5:9 aspect ratio. 

Watching videos in both portrait and landscape mode is quite comfortable for long periods of time due to how ergonomically friendly it is to grasp with either one or two hands. Even though this isn’t the sharpest panel Samsung has thrown on a phone, the 425 ppi is still extremely satisfying to view. Darker colors are deep in contrast and the vibrant nature of the AMOLED panel makes for a terrific companion for space wallpapers like the one I use from Wallpaper Engine. If you’ve used a modern Samsung smartphone in the past, the S23 will continue to honor the tradition of quality viewing experiences that the company is known for. 
As with what I said about the display, while not the highest of specs being offered by Samsung, the triple camera setup is more than enough for a modern smartphone user. In fact, I’m immensely impressed with the results this shooter gave me while using it as my only camera on a trip to a scenic Florida at the start of summer. The 50 MP f/1.8 wide sensor that you’ll be using most often, covers a terrific amount of ground without warping the image. Actually, the 12 MP f/2.2 ultrawide also does a terrific job of expanding the frame without making the image look abnormal. I avoid using ultrawide on some phones due to the fisheye barrel distortion, but S23 has my confidence. They do a good job of retaining what my eye sees in person.
