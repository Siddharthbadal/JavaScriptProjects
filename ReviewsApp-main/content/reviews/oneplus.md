__The OnePlus 12R__ has just arrived in the US, and not a moment too soon. It’s the first __$500__ smartphone we’ve seen in a while that gives the Samsung Galaxy A54 and Google Pixel 7A any serious competition.
<br/> <br/>
Each of these devices is a slightly different answer to the same questions: What’s absolutely essential in a phone? What do you keep when you can’t have it all? Maybe you can’t live without wireless charging, or you want thorough water resistance and a big screen, or __you want a high-end processor so the phone feels faster for longer.__ Guess what? You’ve got choices now! You can afford to be picky with more options on the table.
<br/> 
It all starts with the screen. _The OnePlus 12R comes with a 6.78-inch display_, bigger than the __6.1-inch Pixel 7A__ and 6.4-inch Galaxy A54 screens. Resolution is slightly higher than 1080p, which feels like just enough pixels to cover such a massive display. It offers a maximum refresh rate of 120Hz, and it uses a technology called low-temperature polycrystalline oxide, or LTPO, to downshift all the way to 1Hz. Other high refresh rate screens on budget phones shift between a couple of settings, like 60 and 90Hz. LTPO panels are much more common among flagship phones, and they offer a truly variable refresh rate, which saves on battery life.
